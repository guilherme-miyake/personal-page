    Brazilian born and raised, I got a degree in Civil Engineering, but started working with software
    development at a start-up just as I was leaving college in 2017. I've learned much about programming ever since, and
    even more about working together with people.`,
    "bio text 1": `
    My areas of expertise are data engineering, back-end development, '90s jokes and references, lyrics of songs
    I don't know, general trivia and information, failing and learning fast, dynamic reading, being literal and
    concise; or subjective and long winded.`,

    "summary text 0": `
    I'm currently engaged in building containerized and/or modular solutions for our data infrastructure and platform using tools and languages 
    such as Kafka, Airflow, Python, Terraform, Kotlin and Spring Framework, but I started not that long ago writing VBA
    scripts on MS Excel and JS scripts on Google Scripts.`,
    "summary text 1": `
    I have always enjoyed tackling new challenges and building or implementing solutions that are a just fit for their problems, and
    I have a firm believe in deliveries that are just better; as simple as possible; and that solve a single issue at the time.`,
    "summary text 2": `
    And I love to work in environments where everyone is treated with empathy; where anyone can voice their opinions, 
    experiences and questions without fear or shame; and were we can share our knowledge and learn new things on the job.

    First and foremost, my working purpose and motivation is to solve problems at their source, enable 
     activities and improve experiences using software development.`,
    "extended summary text 1": `    
    I believe that my duty, as an engineer and developer, is to deliver solutions and to improve on the process of 
    delivering them, not delivering or compromising the ability to make further deliveries in any project should only 
    be done with an agreed on strategy between any affected party.`,
    "extended summary text 2": `
    In my experience, I'm good at learning new technologies, breaking down complex problems, making questions 
     and proposing multiple and unusual solutions; on the other hand I'm not great at solving issues with long 
     feedback loops, or issues with subjective or unclear goals. Also, I usually prefer to develop and implement 
     solutions that are either very simple or suited to a specific problem at hand.`,
    "extended summary text 3": `
    At last, my favorite people and teams to work with are honest with their opinions and use empathy to express them,
     and they have my admiration when they make an effort to adapt their language and to reduce the amount of noise and
     miscommunication.`,
