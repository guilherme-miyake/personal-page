    "hobbies title": `What are my hobbies?`,
    "hobbies text 0": `I love to play all kind of games, ranging from tabletop RPG to action
                shooters on my gaming rig. When not playing anything tabletop or otherwise, I have an unhealthy habit of
                binge reading anything that manages to grab my attention.`,
    "hobbies text 1": `When feeling more social I usually enjoy drinking and talking the night away with friends, the more
                absurd or complex the subject the better.`,
    "hobbies text 2": `Also, Music. All of the time. When doing most of my stuff I will usually be listening to a playlist
                composed of Ska/Punk/Rock/Reggae/Indie/Folk/Pop.`,

    "software title": `Why do you work in Software Development?`,
    "software text 0": `I remember playing computer games just as I was learning to read, I remember
                writing my first webpage on plain HTML shortly after, and I have been breaking and fixing many computer
                and software related issues ever since.`,
    "software text 1": `All in all, getting to work in the area was just a matter of improving and becoming an professional at
                what I used to do for fun, and staying on track, a way to find success and enable many projects I would
                like to develop.`,

    "degree title": `What about your degree in Civil Engineering?`,
    "degree text 0": `I'm proud of it, and it helped a lot on my current career path, because earning it, I 
                improved on most of the basic hard and soft skills I use to this very day; I challenged and expanded on 
                what I believed were my limits; I acquired a perspective common to all engineers, and still 
                different from most of my coworkers.`,
    "degree text 1": `Professionally, I wouldn't mind returning to the Civil Engineering area in order to help research 
                and develop exciting new technologies and solutions, but this is not a priority for me and advancing my
                career as a software developer is bringing me closer to the skills required to work in projects I'm
                interested in.`,
    "degree text 2": ` Also, I get to say that I could design a bridge or skyscraper, which sounds very impressive
                even if not likely to happen`,
