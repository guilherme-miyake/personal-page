    "bio text 0": `Brazilian born and raised, I got a degree in Civil Engineering, but started working with software

    even more about working together with people.`,
    "bio text 1": `My areas of expertise are data engineering, back-end development, '90s jokes and references, lyrics of songs
    I don't know, general trivia and information, failing and learning fast, dynamic reading and being a little too 
    literal or concise at times.`,

    "hobbies text 0": `I love to play all kind of games, ranging from tabletop RPG to action

    "software text 0": `I remember playing computer games just as I was learning to read, I remember

                and software related issues ever since.`,
    "software text 1": `All in all, getting to work in the area was just a matter of improving and becoming an professional at

    "degree title": `What about your degree in Civil Engineering?`,
    "degree text 0": `I'm proud of it, and it helped a lot on my current career path, because earning it, I 
                improved on most of the basic hard and soft skills I use to this very day; I challenged and expanded on 
                what I believed were my limits; I acquired a perspective common to all engineers, and still 
                different from most of my coworkers.`,
    "degree text 1": `Professionally, I wouldn't mind returning to the Civil Engineering area in order to help research 
                and develop exciting new technologies and solutions, but this is not a priority for me and advancing my
                career as a software developer is bringing me closer to the skills required to work in projects I'm
                interest in.`,
    "degree text 2": ` Also, I get to say that I could design a bridge or skyscraper, which sounds very impressive
                even if not likely to happen`,
